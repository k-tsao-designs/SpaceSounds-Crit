			<h3>Types of Space Bodies</h3>

				<p id="topP"><span>Black Hole: </span>
				a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing, not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light, can escape from inside it.</p>

				<p><span>Galaxy: </span>
				A gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.</p>

				<p><span>Nebula: </span>
				An interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases.</p>

				<p><span>Star: </span>
				A luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. It shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space.</p>

				<p><span>Planet: </span>
				An astronomical object orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its neighbouring region of planetesimals.</p>

				<p><span>Moon: </span>
				An astronomical object that orbits a planet or minor planet. They can be formed out of the same collapsing region of the protoplanetary disk that created its primary or captured asteroids possibly further fragmented by collisions.</p>

				<p><span>Asteroid: </span>
				A minor planet, or any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that does not show the disc of a planet and is not observed to have the characteristics of an active comet.</p>

				<p><span>Comet: </span>
				An icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, heats up and begins to outgas, displaying a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail.</p>
